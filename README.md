# **Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock**

A classic game brought to us by the hit TV show: The Big Bang Theory. A spin off on the still popular game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. The site hopes to entertain mostly a younger audience and get them familiar with the concepts of the game.

#### - **Game-Area**

At first the rules of the game are displayed to show which gesture takes and is taken by other gestures. Then when the user starts the game by choosing a gesture, the images change, showing which gesture was chosen by the user and which gesture was chosen by the computer. This is the main element of the site.
